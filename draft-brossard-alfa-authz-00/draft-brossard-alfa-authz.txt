         ALFA 2.0 - the Abbreviated Language for Authorization
                    draft-brossard-alfa-authz-latest

Abstract

   The Abbreviated Language for Authorization 2.0 is a constrained
   policy language aimed at solving fine-grained authorization
   challenges.  This specification builds on top of [XACML] and replaces
   [ALFA] to provide a more complete and easier language to use.

   Use cases for ALFA 2.0 include the ability to express: - Role-based
   access control ([RBAC]), - Attribute-based access control ([ABAC]),
   and - Relationship-based access control ([ReBAC])

1.  Introduction

   While authentication has _largely_ been solved and standardized (see
   [OAUTH] and SAML as successful authentication standards), not as much
   can be said of authorization.  One of the oldest and more mature
   standards is [XACML], the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language
   established in 2001 under the helm of OASIS.  The latest version,
   XACML 3.0, was released in 2013.

   Since, there has been little innovation in the authorization space.
   Two standards emerged:

   *  ALFA: Abbreviated Language for Authorization (ALFA) is a domain-
      specific language for a high-level description of XACML policies.
      It is designed with ease of use in mind, for use by XACML policy
      writers.  ALFA provides the means to present domain specific
      information, such as attribute identifiers, in compact form and
      lays down the basic principle to compile policies expressed in
      ALFA into XACML 3.0 policies.  ALFA does not bring new semantics
      to XACML.  Anything that can be expressed in ALFA must be
      expressible in XACML.  ALFA has been designed in such a way that
      lossless round-trip translations is possible.

   *  OPA: Open Policy Agent is an open source, general-purpose policy
      engine that unifies policy enforcement across the stack.  OPA
      provides a high-level declarative language that lets you specify
      policy as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making
      from your software.  [OPA]

   While OPA became part of CNCF, ALFA remained as a draft under OASIS.
   OPA's strength is also its drawback.  It's a fullblown Datalog-based
   programming language which can achieve anything: it's extremely
   broad.  As for ALFA, as mentioned above, it's true to XACML and aims
   to achieve lossless round-trip translations leading to unnecessary
   complications in ALFA's existing grammar.

   The aim of this standard is to provide a simple and constrained
   authorization language largely inspired by ALFA but not tied to XACML
   and not limited by the need to provide round-tripping.
